# css-animate-3d

Bounce ball on cube that rotates in 3D.
Entirely with CSS only. 

Just started learning by watching some youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdftnCDwKaU&t=125s.
Tweaked it to my own likings. And it's actually quite easy to follow.
Also made the code work on safari as well as chrome.

Just open index.html and watch a nice 3d animation entirely with css !
